This is a simple repo for my experiments with python

# First Project - select_a_file.py  
I'm starting out with a program that can:  
1.) Search a directory for certain filetypes (spreadsheets)  
2.) Prompt the user to select a specific file from the list  
3.) Load that selection into openpyxl to allow for manipulation
